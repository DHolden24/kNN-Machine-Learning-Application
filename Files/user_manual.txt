To run this application, make sure that your run configuration is set to Test/TestEnvrionment.

1. Start application and click Create -> New Data Set in the top Menu Bar to start with an 
   empty set of data. A set of sample data can be accessed under Create -> Load Sample Data.
2. Click Edit and choose which type of feature you require
    a) Simple Feature: A feature with a name and a primitive type (Ctrl + S)
    b) Complex Feature: A feature containing two or more simple features (Ctrl + D)
3. Enter a feature name, and for
    a) Simple Features: choose the type, and the metric (see below for descriptions) to be used, and click "Add"
    b) Complex Features: add two or more subfeatures with the "Add a simple subfeature"
       button. Click the "Add" button for each simple feature after initializing the 
       name, and finalize the complex feature by clicking the top "Add this feature"
       button
4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 for at least one more feature.
5. Press "Done" at the bottom to finalize your features.
   NOTE: You cannot add more features after doing this!
6. Click Edit -> Add Value in the top menu bar to add a value (Ctrl + A)
7. Fill in each text field and press done. You will encounter an error message if
   a entered value is incompatible or blank.
   NOTE: You cannot edit a value after clicking done!
8. Continue steps 6 - 7 until all your data is inputted.
9. Create a test case by clicking Create -> New Test Case in the top menu bar (Ctrl + N)
10. Choose a value to test from the drop-down list and click OK.
11. Choose a distance metric (see below for descriptions) to use. If you choose Minkowski, you will also have to choose a poynomial
    value between 3 and 6.
11. Fill out the text fields provided to provide the remaining information
12. Fill the field at the bottom for the K value and click Done.
13. Your test case result will be displayed on the bottom of the page.
14. You can execute any number of test cases, and add any number of values
    after you execute a test case

	     - Hit the done button and the data will be saved.
2. Loading   - Choose the Load menu. Then "Import Data".
	     - Type in the location of the file or file you plan on saving to in the prompt window.
	     - Hit the done button and the data will be saved.

Individual Feature Distance Metrics

1.  Numerical
	Differenece  	    - The distance between two features is the absolute difference of the values.
	Equality     	    - The distance between two features is 0 if they are equal, and 1 otherwise. 
	Standard Deviation  - The distance between two features is 0 if they are within the same (minimal) number of 
				standard deviations from the mean, and 1 otherwise.

2.  String
	Hamming		    - The distance between two features is the number of character changes needed to convert
				one string to another.
	Equal		    - The distance between two features is 0 if they are equal, and 1 otherwise.
	Character Value	    - The distance between two features is the absolute difference between the sums of the
				character ASCII values in each string.

********************************************
Set Distance Metrics

1.  Euclidean	- The distance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the feature distances.
2.  Manhattan	- The distance is the sum of the feature distances
3.  Minkowski	- The distance is the nth rooth of the sum of each feature distance to the power of n, where n is 
			specified by the user. This is a generalized version of Euclidean and Manhattan.
4.  Chebyshev	- The distance is the most significant feature distance.
